/// TERMS OF USE / EULA GATE — PRE-LOGIN GATE VERSION
/// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// Shown as soon as AuthController.login() has verified the entered
/// email/password against Firebase Auth but found that the matching
/// e-users doc does not yet have 'termsAccepted' == true. Login is
/// intentionally left incomplete at that point — no FCM token save, no
/// presence update, no theme/chat setup, no navigation to '/home' — so
/// this screen is the only thing standing between the user and their
/// account.
///
/// On accept: writes 'termsAccepted' + 'termsAcceptedAt' to the user's
/// e-users doc, signs the user back out, and returns to '/login'. The
/// user must then log in again; on that second attempt
/// AuthController.login() will see termsAccepted == true and complete
/// the full login flow normally.
///
/// On decline: signs the user out and returns to '/login' without
/// recording acceptance, so the next login attempt hits this gate again.
///
/// Firestore (not SharedPreferences) is the source of truth here since
/// nothing on this screen runs before Firebase Auth already has a
/// signed-in user — this also means acceptance follows the account
/// across devices/reinstalls.
///
/// Wire-up: called via Get.off(() => const TermsOfUseScreen()) from
/// AuthController.login().
